    <h1>About The App</h1>
    <p>
        Our app allows users to report ICE raids in their communities to alert those who have signed up. If a raid is reported, a text message will immediately be sent out to all registered members. <br /><br />

        Since this application's information is generated by individuals from your local community, we cannot guarantee the validity of all reported sightings. <br /><br />

        Many features of our project were inspired by Redad Alertas. Learn more <a href="http://redadalertas.com">here</a>.
